            <p>
                <code>var</code> works exactly like <a href="/features/val"><code>val</code></a>, except the local variable is <em>not</em> marked as <code>final</code>.
            </p><p>
                The type is still entirely derived from the mandatory initializer expression, and any further assignments, while now legal (because the variable is no longer <code>final</code>), aren't looked at to determine the appropriate type.<br />
                For example, <code>var x = "Hello"; x = Color.RED;</code> does <em>not</em> work; the type of x will be inferred to be <code>java.lang.String</code> and thus, the <code>x = Color.RED</code> assignment will fail. If the type of <code>x</code> was inferred to be <code>java.lang.Object</code> this code would have compiled, but that's not how<code>var</code> works.

                Lombok will flag any usage of <code>var</code> as a warning or error if configured.
